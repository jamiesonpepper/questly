> [!NOTE]
> ### Built with AI
>
> Every line of this project — the application code, the stylesheet, the icons
> and this README — was written by **Claude** (Anthropic's Claude Opus 5)
> running in Claude Code, to a human's direction. Every commit carries a
> `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, so the history is honest about it.
>
> It is not untested. `tests/smoke_test.py` walks every flow end to end against
> a real MongoDB — awarding, spending, approving, refunding, PIN login, account
> changes — and every screen was driven in a browser during development.
>
> It has **not** had a third-party security audit, and it hasn't run anywhere
> long enough to call it battle-tested. It is a family app intended for a
> trusted home network. Read the code before running it on anything you care
> about, as you would with any code you find on the internet.

Self-hosted, no accounts with anyone else, no ads, no subscriptions. It runs on
a spare machine or a NAS and is used from any phone, tablet or laptop on the
same network. The layout is mobile-first and installs to a home screen as a
web app.

- **Two sides.** Grown-ups log in with an email and password. Kids tap their
  avatar and type a 4–6 digit PIN — or no PIN at all for the youngest.
- **Quests** — recurring jobs worth points. A kid taps **Done!**, a grown-up
  approves, the points land.
- **A shop** you stock yourself, with prices, icons and optional limited stock.
- **A full ledger.** Every point in or out is recorded with a running balance.

## Install on Unraid

Questly is in **Community Applications** — search for *Questly* in the Apps tab.

It needs a MongoDB server, which isn't bundled: install one from Community
Applications first, then point Questly's `MONGO_URI` at it. Questly keeps no
local state, so there's no appdata share to configure and nothing to back up
but the database.

---

## Requirements

Docker Engine with the Compose plugin (`docker compose`). Nothing else — Python
and MongoDB both run inside containers. Works on x86-64 and ARM64.

## Quick start

Pre-built multi-architecture images (amd64 and arm64) are published on every
release:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/mahansford/questly:latest   # or hansford909/questly:latest
```

To run the whole stack, database included:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahansford/questly.git && cd questly
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set a real `SECRET_KEY` in `.env`:

```bash
sed -i.bak "s|^SECRET_KEY=.*|SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|" .env && rm -f .env.bak
```

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open **http://localhost:37000**. The first visit asks you to create a grown-up
account, then walks you to the Family page to add your kids.

### Optional: start with example content

Fills the shop and quest board with sensible starter items (and, if the app is
completely empty, two demo kids):

```bash
docker compose exec web flask --app wsgi:app seed-demo
```

---

## How it works

| Thing | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Award points** | Quick `+10 / +25 / +50 / +100` buttons on each kid's card, or any custom amount, with an optional reason. Points can be taken away too. |
| **Quests** | Recurring jobs (daily, weekly or one-off) worth a set number of points, assignable to specific kids or everyone. Set *Times each* above 1 for something worth doing repeatedly — a tidy-up round three times a day. A kid taps **Done!**, you approve, the points land. |
| **Shop** | Rewards you create, each with a point cost, an icon and a description. Stock can be unlimited, a fixed number that runs out, or an allowance that refills — "2 a day each" or "1 a month for the family to share". |
| **Saving up** | A child can pick any reward to save for, and their home screen tracks progress toward it. Left alone, it shows whichever reward is closest. |
| **Themes** | Eight colour themes children pick for themselves, changing their accent colour and background. |
| **Notifications** | Everyone gets an in-app feed with an unread badge. On top of that, each person can have their own delivery channels — so a young child sees notifications only in the app, an older one gets ntfy on their tablet, and you get Signal on your phone. |
| **Buying** | Points are deducted the moment a kid buys, and the reward queues up for you to hand over. Turning a request down refunds the points automatically. |
| **Approvals** | One page listing every quest and purchase waiting on you, with a count badge in the nav. |
| **Accounts** | Each grown-up can change their own name, login email, icon and password, and stay signed in on a trusted device. |
| **Locked out?** | Either grown-up can set a new password for the other, confirmed with their own password. There is no email recovery, so this is the way back in. |

### The rules it enforces

- A kid can never go below zero points, and can't overspend by double-tapping
  Buy — the deduction is a conditional atomic update.
- Two kids racing for the last limited-stock item can't both win it, for the
  same reason.
- A daily quest can be claimed once per calendar day and a weekly one once per
  ISO week, both in the timezone set by `TZ`.
- Rejecting a quest claim lets the kid try again in the same period.
- A refilling allowance resets on its own — nothing to top up — and rejecting a
  purchase frees its slot again.
- Every mutation is CSRF-protected, and kids can't reach grown-up pages.

---

## Notifications

Every notification is recorded in the app first, with an unread badge — that
needs no setup, no permissions and nothing installed. Children are told when
something new appears in the shop, when a quest or purchase is decided, when
they're awarded points, and when they can finally afford what they're saving
for. Grown-ups are told when something needs approving.

Each person can then add their own **delivery channels** on top, set up by a
grown-up under *Family* (for a child) or *My account* (for themselves):

| Channel | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **ntfy** | Free push to a phone or tablet. Best fit for children — they subscribe to a topic, no account needed. Use the public `ntfy.sh` or your own server. |
| **Signal** | Signal has no public API, so this posts to a self-hosted [signal-cli-rest-api](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api) bridge, which is itself in Unraid Community Apps. Sends to individuals **or a group chat** — hit *Find my groups* and pick one rather than hunting for its id. Groups only appear once the bridge has synced: in its default `normal` mode call `/v1/receive/<number>` once, or run it with `MODE=json-rpc` so it stays synced. Messages use Signal's own formatting, so titles arrive in bold. |
| **Gotify** | Self-hosted push server with Android and web clients. |
| **Telegram** | Via a bot you create with @BotFather. |
| **Discord** | Posts into a channel through a webhook. |
| **Pushover** | Paid one-off app for iOS and Android. |
| **Webhook** | Posts `{"title", "body"}` as JSON to anything — Home Assistant, Node-RED, your own script. |

Each channel can be limited to particular kinds of update, and there's a
**Test** button that sends a message immediately so you know it works.

Messages carry the detail you need to act without opening the app. A purchase
tells you which child bought what, the cost, what they have left, the item's
description and what to do next; a finished quest tells you which child, which
quest, how often it repeats and what it pays.

Sends happen on a background thread, so a slow or unreachable endpoint never
holds up the app, and a failure is logged rather than shown to a child.

> **Why not lock-screen push from the app itself?** Web Push needs a service
> worker, which browsers only run over HTTPS, and on iOS it additionally
> requires the app to be installed to the home screen. Questly serves plain
> HTTP on a home network, so it can't. Channels like ntfy sidestep that
> entirely: the server makes an outbound call, so no certificate is needed.
> If you put HTTPS in front of Questly, Web Push becomes possible.

## Configuration

Everything is set in `.env`, which Docker Compose reads:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `37000` | Host port the app is served on |
| `SECRET_KEY` | — | **Set this.** Signs session cookies |
| `MONGO_DB` | `questly` | Database name |
| `MONGO_URI` | bundled container | Only needed for an external MongoDB — see below |
| `TZ` | `Europe/London` | Drives dates and daily/weekly quest resets |

`.env` is gitignored, so secrets stay out of version control.

---

## Using a MongoDB you already run

The compose file ships a MongoDB container for convenience, but the app is
happy talking to any MongoDB 5+ instance. Set `MONGO_URI` in `.env` and start
only the web service:

```bash
docker compose up -d --no-deps web
```

`--no-deps` is what stops Compose from also starting the bundled `mongo`
service. Without it you get two databases running and only one in use.

MongoDB has to be reachable from *inside* the web container, which means one of:

- **Same docker network** — put both containers on the same *user-defined*
  network and address it by container name (`mongodb://my-mongodb:27017/`).
  Docker's default `bridge` network does not resolve container names, so a
  custom network is required.
- **Via the host** — publish MongoDB's port and point at the host's LAN IP
  (`mongodb://192.168.1.50:27017/`).

With authentication enabled, include the credentials and the auth database:
`mongodb://user:pass@host:27017/?authSource=admin`.

The app creates its own collections and indexes on first use, so an empty
database is all it needs. It only ever touches the database named by
`MONGO_DB`, so sharing an instance with other apps is fine.

> **Running on a NAS?** Docker *named volumes* often live inside a fixed-size
> virtual disk that your normal share backups don't cover. Either bind-mount
> the database to real storage or point `MONGO_URI` at a MongoDB container you
> manage yourself.

---

## On your home network

Once it's running, the app is reachable from other devices at
`http://<server-ip>:37000` — handy for kids on tablets and phones. Find the
address with `hostname -I` (Linux) or `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (macOS). A DHCP
reservation in your router keeps it from changing.

### Install it to a home screen

Open that address on the device and choose **Add to Home Screen** (Share menu
on iOS, browser menu on Android). It launches full-screen with its own icon and
no browser chrome, which is how it's meant to be used.

> Questly speaks plain HTTP and assumes a trusted home network. Don't expose it
> to the internet without putting HTTPS and, ideally, a VPN in front of it.

---

## Everyday commands

```bash
docker compose up -d          # start
docker compose down           # stop (data is kept)
docker compose logs -f web    # tail the app logs
docker compose up --build -d  # rebuild after changing the code
```

Add a grown-up from the command line — useful if everyone is locked out:

```bash
docker compose exec web flask --app wsgi:app create-parent
```

### Backing up

All data lives in the `mongo-data` Docker volume.

```bash
docker compose exec -T mongo mongodump --db questly --archive --gzip > questly-backup.gz
```

Restore:

```bash
docker compose exec -T mongo mongorestore --archive --gzip --drop < questly-backup.gz
```

### Starting completely over

```bash
docker compose down -v        # -v also deletes the database volume
```

---

## Development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export SECRET_KEY=dev MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
flask --app wsgi:app run --debug --port 8000
```

You'll need MongoDB listening on `localhost:27017`.

### Tests

An end-to-end smoke test walks every flow — awarding, spending, approving,
refunding, PIN login, account changes, the lot — against a throwaway database:

```bash
docker compose exec -e MONGO_DB=questly_test web python tests/smoke_test.py
```

It refuses to run unless the database name ends in `_test`, so it can't touch
real data.

### Regenerating the icons

Every icon comes from one geometric spec, so the SVG and the PNGs can't drift
apart. Edit `tools/make_icons.py` and run:

```bash
pip install pillow && python tools/make_icons.py
```

That network clause is what AGPL adds over the ordinary GPL, and it's why it
suits a self-hosted app — improvements come back to everyone instead of
disappearing into a closed hosted product.

### Collections

| Collection | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `users` | grown-ups and kids (kids carry their cached balance) |
| `transactions` | the point ledger — every change, with balance after |
| `rewards` | shop items |
| `redemptions` | purchases and their approval state |
| `quests` | the quest board |
| `quest_claims` | a kid's claim on a quest for one period |

The app has no JavaScript build step and no frontend dependencies — it's Jinja
templates, one stylesheet and one small script.
